# Kerbal-Space-Agency
A KSP playlist of music from Kitten Space Agency (as of 11-15-2025) using Soundtrack Editor Forked. The current tracks include: Stardance, Sun Synchronous, Drifting, LEO Sunrise, Liminal Space, and Small Blue Dot.

Dependencies are Soundtrack Editor Forked by linuxgurugamer and its dependencies. Install Soundtrack Editor Forked (and its dependencies normally, then install Kerbal Space Agency into the same KSP root folder, replacing the playlists.cfg when prompted.

An additional, optional playlist is included to also add Kitten Space Agency music the the added bodies in the JNSQ planet pack. Why? Eh, I love JNSQ, that's about it. All you need to do is copy and paste every line in the 'JNSQ playlist' config into the normal 'playlists' config, adding the new lines to the bottom of the file.
